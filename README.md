# Neighborhood Map Udacity Project

##  Project Details
I've developed this project as a part of Udacity's FullStack Nanodegree program. This project consists of a neighborhood(Hyderabad) with hindu nearby. I have used the foursquare API to fetch the data and populate the list items and the map markers on google maps.
A feature to filter the list of temples has been provided too. This feature reduces the clutter on the map by hiding unnecessary markers. Hence, you can focus on the markers that you filtered.

## Required Skills to develop the project
- Web development essentials such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Exposure to JavaScript frameworks such as KnockoutJS
- Exposure to using third-party APIs

## Using the application

``` Open index.html in any browser to run the project ```
- If there is trouble loading google maps or fetching temple data from foursquare API, you will be alerted informing you about the problem.
- Once, the map loads, the list items populate and map markers drop on the map.
- Next, you can play around on the map by entering text in the filter input, clicking on the list items, click map markers and so on...
